"""10-6. 
Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs
when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert the input to an
int, youâ€™ll get a ValueError. Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Add them
together and print the result. Catch the ValueError if either input value is not a number,
and print a friendly error message. Test your program by entering two numbers and
then by entering some text instead of a number
