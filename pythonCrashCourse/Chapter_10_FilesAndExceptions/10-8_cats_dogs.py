"""10-8. 
Cats and Dogs: Make two files, cats.txt and dogs.txt. Store at least three names
of cats in the first file and three names of dogs in the second file. Write a program that
tries to read these files and print the contents of the file to the screen. Wrap your code
in a try-except block to catch the FileNotFound error, and print a friendly message if a
file is missing. Move one of the files to a different location on your system, and make
sure the code in the except block executes properly.
