Simpler Code: The program file_reader.py in this section uses a temporary
variable, lines, to show how splitlines() works. You can skip the temporary variable
and loop directly over the list that splitlines() returns:
for line in contents.splitlines():
Remove the temporary variable from each of the programs in this section, to make
them more concise.
