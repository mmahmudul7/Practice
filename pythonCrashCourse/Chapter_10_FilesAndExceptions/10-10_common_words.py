Common Words: Visit Project Gutenberg (https://gutenberg.org) and find a few
texts you’d like to analyze. Download the text files for these works, or copy the raw text
from your browser into a text file on your computer.
You can use the count() method to find out how many times a word or phrase appears
in a string. For example, the following code counts the number of times 'row' appears
in a string:
>>> line = "Row, row, row your boat"
>>> line.count('row')
2
>>> line.lower().count('row')
3
Notice that converting the string to lowercase using lower() catches all appearances of
the word you’re looking for, regardless of how it’s formatted.
Write a program that reads the files you found at Project Gutenberg and determines
how many times the word 'the' appears in each text. This will be an approximation
because it will also count words such as 'then' and 'there'. Try counting 'the ', with
a space in the string, and see how much lower your count is.
