Learning Python: Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines
summarizing what youâ€™ve learned about Python so far. Start each line with the phrase
In Python you can. . . . Save the file as learning_python.txt in the same directory as
your exercises from this chapter.
Write a program that reads the file and prints what you wrote two times: print the 
contents once by reading in the entire file, and once by storing the lines in a list
and then looping over each line.
