"""11-2. Population: Modify your function so it requires a third parameter, population. It
should now return a single string of the form City, Country – population xxx, such as
Santiago, Chile – population 5000000. Run the test again, and make sure
test_city_country() fails this time.

Modify the function so the population parameter is optional. Run the test, and make
sure test_city_country() passes again.

Write a second test called test_city_country_population() that verifies you can call
your function with the values 'santiago', 'chile', and 'population=5000000'. Run the
tests one more time, and make sure this new test passes."""
