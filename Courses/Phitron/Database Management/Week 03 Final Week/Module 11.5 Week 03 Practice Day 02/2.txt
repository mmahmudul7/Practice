The main difference between executing an SQL query using Python and executing it in MySQL Workbench lies in the execution method and use case.
In Python, SQL queries are executed programmatically using a database connector like "mysql-connector" or "PyMySQL", which allows dynamic query generation, automation, and integration into applications. This approach is ideal for tasks like processing data, building applications, or automating repetitive operations.
In contrast, MySQL Workbench provides an interactive, graphical interface for executing SQL queries directly. It is better suited for manual tasks like debugging, schema design, or exploring data. Python offers flexibility and scalability for automated workflows, while MySQL Workbench is primarily designed for hands-on database management.

Python: Best for automation, dynamic queries, and integrating SQL operations into larger applications.

MySQL Workbench: Best for manual, interactive database management and visualization.
