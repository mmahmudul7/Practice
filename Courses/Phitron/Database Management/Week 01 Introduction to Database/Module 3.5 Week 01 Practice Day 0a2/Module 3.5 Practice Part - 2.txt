2. How to make composite primary key constraint? Show with example.

Answer:
To create a composite primary key constraint, specify multiple columns in the PRIMARY KEY clause within the CREATE TABLE statement. List the columns inside parentheses after PRIMARY KEY, which makes them jointly unique, thus ensuring that no two rows have the same combination of values across these columns.

CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
    StudentID INT,
    CourseID INT,
    EnrollmentDate DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseID)
);
