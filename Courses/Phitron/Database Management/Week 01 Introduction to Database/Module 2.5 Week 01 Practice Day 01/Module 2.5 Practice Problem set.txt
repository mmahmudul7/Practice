Questions


1. What is the difference between Data and Information
Answer: Data comprises raw, unprocessed facts that need context to become useful, while information is data that has been processed, organized, and interpreted to add meaning and value.

2. Describe Primary Key, Composite Primary Key, Foreign Key with example?
Answer: A Primary Key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that no two rows have the same value for that column, and it cannot contain NULL values.

A Composite Primary Key is a primary key that consists of two or more columns to uniquely identify each record in a table. It's used when a single column is not enough to uniquely identify a row.

A Foreign Key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It creates a relationship between two tables, enforcing referential integrity by ensuring that the values in the foreign key column must match values in the referenced primary key column.
