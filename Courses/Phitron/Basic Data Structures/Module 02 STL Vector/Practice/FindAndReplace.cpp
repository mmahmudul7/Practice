/*You are given a vector of integers. Your task is to write a C++ program that performs the
following operations:
1. Replace all occurrences of a given value in the vector with another given value.
2. Find the position of the first occurrence of a specific value in the vector.
Input Format:
1. An integer n denoting the number of elements in the vector.
2. n space-separated integers representing the elements of the vector.
3. Two integers old_val and new_val where all occurrences of old_val in the vector
need to be replaced with new_val.
4. An integer find_val for which you need to find the first occurrence in the vector.
Output Format:
1. Print the modified vector after the replacement operation.
Print the index of the first occurrence of find_val in the vector. If find_val is not
found, print -1*/
