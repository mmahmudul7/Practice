A list is an ordered collection of items, each item have index from 0. Items in a list can be accessed using their index. While a dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key serves as a unique identifier for its corresponding value.
Lists are defined using square brackets [], dictionaries are created using curly braces {} and use a colon : to separate keys from values.
