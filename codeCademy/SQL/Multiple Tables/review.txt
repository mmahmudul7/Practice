JOIN
 will combine rows from different tables if the join condition is true.

LEFT JOIN
 will return every row in the left table, and if the join condition is not met, NULL values are used to fill in the columns from the right table.

Primary key
 is a column that serves a unique identifier for the rows in the table.

Foreign key
 is a column that contains the primary key to another table.

CROSS JOIN
 lets us combine all rows of one table with all rows of another table.

UNION
 stacks one dataset on top of another.

WITH
 allows us to define one or more temporary tables that can be used in the final query.
