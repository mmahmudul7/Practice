# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python — Practice Code

This repository contains my practice code, exercises, and experimental scripts while learning from **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (2nd Edition)**.  
All files are for educational and self-improvement purposes only.

## Purpose

- Practice Python from basic to intermediate level
- Recreate and run code examples from the book
- Store solutions and variations for future reference
- Keep track of learning progress
